Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client wanted to make a game called draw it or use it based on a mobile game they already have, but it needed to work on more than one operating system.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I was able to understand the system requirements very well, as I noticed the design patterns that were used in the project
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I thought that being able to keep track of updates is very useful, so that those that go to look at the document in the future can see what the project looked like and where it is now
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I wish I could find more in depth information about operating system requirements, these change very often and from my research typically third party apps used for development handle a lot of this side. But it would have been interesting to take more time and reserach it mroe thourghly
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One instance was implementing the singleton pattern.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think it was very useful to read the document about the swing library and then to write my own documentation within the code.
