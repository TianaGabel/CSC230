# Software requirements
The client wanted to make a game called Draw It or use it based on a mobile game they already have, but it needed to work on more than one operating system. The part of the code I worked with was adding support for a singleton design pattern, user authentication, and debugging the provided swing code.

# Improvements
I wish I could find more in-depth information about operating system requirements, these change very often, and from my research typically third-party apps, such as Xcode or NetBeans, are used for development to handle a lot of this side. But it would have been interesting to take more time and research it more thoroughly
